</div>
<div>
<p class="info">The 2020 season was centered around shooting a 7 inch foam ball into a goal, about the height of a basketball hoop.
as most games go, the name of the game was speed, quickness. Two extra challanges come allong, climbing a 63 inch rung and a hieght restriction.
</p>
<p class="info">
  The robot is allowed to control 5 balls at a time. Inorder to be competative, controlling all five balls at a time is a must. After much protyping we
  we came up with a crude design. The prototype takes a pile of 5 randomly scattered balls, and organizes them in a streight line.

<p class="info">
  After 3 shooter prototypes and many iterations a single wheeled shooter was an obvious choice. Powered by 2 <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/775pro.html" style="color: pink;"> 775 pro motors<a> to
    decrease motor speed and increase torque we added a 2:1 gear ratio with GT2 pulleys. This effectivly decreased our 18,730rpm free speed to 9,365rpm and doubled our troque.
    Our empirical data showed that our speed time for the flywheel decreased, and recovery time per shot was minimal.
