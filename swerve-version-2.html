    This project is an extension of the "Swerve project" with a different goal, performance over all else.
    CNC milling is heavily leveraged to reduce part count and tolerance stack up.

  <p class="info">
The coaxial shaft design is what sets this module apart from its counter parts. The inner shaft is keyed to the motor steering pulley, it indexes the position of the output at a 1:1 ratio. This is suitable for absolute encoding. A magnet at the top of this shaft is the hall effect encoder magnet. The outside of this shaft is a ½” hex which is the second stage of the drive gearbox. The concentric design allows them to both spin at varying speeds and positions without interference. As you can see from the photo above the thin shaft is indexed by putting a hex into a triangular cutout(this shape is suited well for CNC milling), at the top of the shaft you can also see the encoder magnet.
